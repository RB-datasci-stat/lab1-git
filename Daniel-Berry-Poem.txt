Daniel Berry:

The Art of Data

Numbers whisper, patterns gleam,
In lines of code, we chase a dream.
Through tangled knots of raw insight,
We shape the dark and bring in light.

Clusters form, predictions rise,
Hidden truths behind disguise.
From chaos built, we find a way,
Where data speaks, we let it stay.
