Poem: Data Dance

Numbers whisper, patterns shine,
In tangled threads of code divine.
Through graphs and models, truth takes flight,
Turning chaos into sight.

With data’s pulse, we find the way,
From past to future, night to day.
A dance of logic, math, and art—
Where science speaks, and minds take part.
